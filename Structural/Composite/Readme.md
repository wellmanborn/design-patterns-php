![Composite](../../Assets/images/composite.png)

**Composite** is a structural design pattern that allows 
composing objects into a _`tree-like`_ structure and work with it as if it was a singular object.

Composite became a pretty popular solution for the most problems that require building a tree structure. Compositeâ€™s great feature is the ability to run methods recursively over the whole tree structure and sum up the results.
